    <h2 class="recipe-heading">Steps To Make</h2>
    <ol class="adjust_font_weight">
        <li>
            <h3>Soak the rice and lentils</h3>
            <p>
                Combine rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds in a large bowl. 
                Add cold water to cover, and stir for 10 to 15 seconds; drain.
                 Repeat rinsing process twice until water is mostly clear. 
                 Return rice mixture to bowl, and cover with about 4 inches of cold water. Set aside, uncovered, 
                in a warm environment (75°F to 80°F) until rice and lentils double in size, 6 to 8 hours, stirring once after 1 hour.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="recipe-heading">Blend the rice mixture</h3>
            <p>
                Pour rice mixture through a fine wire-mesh strainer set over a large bowl;
                 reserve soaking liquid. Working in 3 batches,
                  transfer about one-third of rice mixture (about 2 1/2 cups) to a high-speed blender;
                   add 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 cup reserved soaking liquid. 
                   Blend on low speed, gradually increasing speed to high, until a smooth, thick batter forms, 1 to 2 minutes, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons additional soaking liquid if needed. (Batter will feel slightly gritty to the touch.) 
                   Pour batter into a large (3- to 4-quart) container. 
                   Repeat process 2 times using remaining rice mixture, remaining salt, and 1 cup reserved soaking liquid, plus more as needed. 
                   (If using a blender that is not high-speed, work in 6 batches, using 1 1/4 cups rice mixture, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 cup reserved soaking liquid for each batch.)
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="recipe-heading">Ferment the batter</h3>
            <p>
                Whisk 1/4 cup reserved soaking liquid into batter; discard remaining soaking liquid.
                 (Batter should resemble thick pancake batter and should fall off whisk in a thick ribbon,
                  leaving a trail on top of batter for about 10 seconds before sinking back into batter.) 
                  Cover container; let stand in a warm environment (75°F to 80°F) until slightly puffed, 
                  bubbles have formed all over, and batter has a sour smell, about 12 hours.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="recipe-heading">Thin the batter</h3>
            <p>Thin batter with 3/4 to 1 cup water, 1/4 cup at a time, 
                until consistency resembles a slightly thickened crêpe batter
                 and batter falls off ladle in a thick ribbon, leaving a 1-second trail on batter surface.

            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3 class="recipe-heading">Spread the batter in the skillet</h3>
            <p>
                Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high. 
                Brush hot skillet lightly with melted coconut oil, 
                wiping with a paper towel to remove excess oil. 
                Ladle 1/4 cup batter in center of skillet. Using bottom of ladle, 
                quickly spread batter outward in a spiral motion,
                 applying even, constant pressure to form a thin 6- to 8-inch round. 
                (Stop spreading once ladle begins to stick to pan.)
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="recipe-heading">Cook the dosa</h3>
            <p>
                Drizzle about 1/2 teaspoon oil around edge and on top of dosa; cook until bottom browns, 
                edge crisps, and top is set, about 2 minutes. If desired, flip dosa, 
                and cook until second side is very lightly browned, 10 to 15 seconds. 
                Loosen dosa edge using a thin spatula. Add about 3 tablespoons Aloo Masala to half of dosa; 
                fold dosa over filling, and serve immediately. Repeat as desired to make more dosas.
                 Leftover batter can be refrigerated, covered, up to 2 weeks.
